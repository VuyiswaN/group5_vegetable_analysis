# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the seasonal fluctuations in vegetable prices over the course of a year. By examining historical data, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing these price variations.

# Data
The dataset used in this analysis consists of historical vegetable price data collected from various regions throughout 2023. This data includes:

Vegetable Name: Tomato, Potato, Onion, Bhindi (Ladies finger), Brinjal, Garlic, Peas, Methi, Green Chilli, Elephant Yam (Suran)
Date: The Data was collected for calendar year of 2023

# Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Convert data to appropriate formats (e.g., date-time).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of vegetable prices over time.
Identify seasonal patterns and trends.
Explore the relationship between different vegetable prices.
Statistical Analysis:
Perform hypothesis testing to determine if there are significant differences in prices between seasons.

### Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively, including line plots, bar charts, and kde plots.
